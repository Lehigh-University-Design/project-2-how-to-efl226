                <h1>Turntable with a Built-in Preamp</h1>
                <p><b>What it is:</b> A preamp (short for preamplifier) is a device that boosts the very weak electrical signal from the record's needle up to a standard level that other equipment can use. 
                    Many modern turntables have a preamp built right in. This is the most user-friendly option, as you can plug the turntable directly into a pair of powered 
                    speakers or any amplifier's AUX input, making it a simple "plug-and-play" experience.
                </p>
                <p><b>Good example:</b> The Audio-Technica AT-LP60X. This is widely considered one of the best entry-level turntables on the market. 
                    It's fully automatic, affordable, reliable, and its built-in preamp means you don't need to buy extra boxes to get started.
                </p>

                <h1>Turntable without a Preamp</h1>
                <p><b>What it is:</b> Higher-end or vintage turntables often don't include a preamp. 
                    This gives the user more control over the sound quality by allowing them to choose their own external phono preamp. 
                    You must connect this type of turntable to either a separate preamp box or an amplifier that has a dedicated "PHONO" input (which means the amp has its own preamp inside). 
                    This path is for enthusiasts who want to build and upgrade their system over time.
                </p>
                <p><b>Good example:</b> The Pro-Ject Debut Carbon EVO. This is a beautiful, minimalist turntable beloved by audiophiles as a first major step up in quality.
                     It focuses on high-quality components for better sound, giving you the freedom to pair it with the external preamp of your choice.

        <h1>Amplifiers</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="block-container">
            <div class="inner-block">
                <h1>Integrated Amplifier</h1>
                <p><b>What it is:</b> An integrated amplifier is the central hub of a traditional stereo system. 
                    It combines two jobs in one box: a preamplifier (which lets you switch between different inputs like your turntable, CD player, etc., 
                    and control the volume) and a power amplifier (which provides the actual power needed to drive the speakers). 
                    Itâ€™s the most common and practical choice for a high-quality home audio setup.
                </p>
                <p><b>Good example:</b> The Cambridge Audio AXA35. This is a fantastic-sounding and well-built 
                    integrated amplifier that provides everything a beginner needs, including a dedicated phono input for turntables that don't have a built-in preamp.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "image-container">

            <div class="inner-block">
                <h1>Amplifier Separates (Preamp + Power Amp)</h1>
                <p><b>What it is:</b> For audiophiles seeking the absolute best performance, the preamplifier and power amplifier can be purchased as two separate components. 
                    The theory is that by separating the delicate, low-voltage work of the preamp from the high-current, 
                    heavy-lifting of the power amp, you reduce electrical interference and get a cleaner sound. 
                    This setup offers maximum quality and flexibility but is more complex and expensive.
                </p>
                <p><b>Good example:</b> The Schiit Audio "Saga S" (preamp) and "Vidar 2" (power amp). 
                    Schiit is a popular American company known for high-performance audio at reasonable prices.
                     This combination is a classic example of a "separates" system that provides immense power and clarity.

    <div class="block-container">
            <div class="inner-block">
                <h1>Powered (Active) Speakers</h1>
                <p><b>What it is:</b> Powered speakers, also called "active" speakers, have the amplifier built directly into the speaker cabinet. 
                    This drastically simplifies your setup. You just plug the main speaker into a wall outlet, connect the second speaker to the first, and you're ready to go. 
                    They are the perfect partner for a turntable with a built-in preamp, creating a complete, minimal system.
                </p>
                <p><b>Good example:</b> The Kanto YU4. These are stylish, compact powered speakers that sound excellent and are incredibly versatile. 
                    They come in various colors and even have their own built-in phono preamp, meaning you could connect almost any turntable directly to them.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="inner-block">
                <h1>Passive Speakers</h1>
                <p><b>What it is:</b> Passive speakers are the "traditional" type of speaker. They do not have a built-in amplifier and therefore cannot produce sound on their own. 
                    They must be connected to an external amplifier (like an integrated amp) using speaker wire. 
                    The amplifier sends the power and the audio signal to the speakers. This approach allows for endless mixing and matching of components to fine-tune your sound.
                </p>
                <p><b>Good example:</b> The ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2. These bookshelf speakers are legendary in the audio world for offering incredible sound quality at a very affordable price. 
                    They are a fantastic example of a passive speaker that can serve as the foundation of a great-sounding traditional Hi-Fi system.
