                <h2>What is Analog Audio?</h2>
                <p>Vinyl records are analog sound-storage discs made of plastic (polyvinyl chloride). 
                    They were the main format for music playback in the 20th century and have seen a recent revival among enthusiasts. 
                    The grooves on a record physically encode the music. When a record spins, a stylus (needle) rides in the spiral groove. 
                    Each tiny wiggle in the groove corresponds to the original sound wave, and the stylus picks up these vibrations as it moves

                <h2>Why Should I Care About Vinyl?</h2>
                <p>Vinyl isn’t just about sound — it’s about ritual. 
                    People love the crackle before the first note, the weight of the record in their hands,
                     the artwork you can actually get lost in. Unlike a playlist that disappears into the background, 
                     vinyl demands attention: you flip it, you drop the needle, you sit with it. It’s music you don’t just hear, 
                     but hold. That tangible, imperfect, all-in experience is why vinyl keeps finding its way back into people’s lives.
